# nosql-challenge

I started with the starter code and modified it to fulfill the requirements. I used the examples from class to do the required tasks.

The mongo database must be imported with the command: `mongoimport --type json -d uk_food -c establishments --drop --jsonArray establishments.json`

Then, the NoSQL_setup notebook must be run in its entirety. Then, the NoSQL_analysis notebook must be run to get the desired output.
